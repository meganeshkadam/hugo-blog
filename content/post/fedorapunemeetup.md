We also had our regular technical discussions, during this event.

The event started with the introductions and we had someone very senior from Fedora community this time, [Parag Nemade](https://twitter.com/paraagan) who discussed about his journey with Fedora, his contributions and some good points

In the technical discussion, we discussed on few OpenSource Project ideas.We have also started working on one such

we are sure, this project will be accomplished in our decided timeline.
