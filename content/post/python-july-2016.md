Session started with as usual introductions of the attendees.[Chandan](https://twitter.com/ciypro.com) briefly
explained about the Meetup motive and also few other announcements regarding

[Rahul](https://www.facebook.com/rahul.bajaj.7568596?fref=ts) started with his talk on using the Regular Expressions in Python. It was introductory, and he have also explained it with the pretty good example
where he have implemnted the RE in his demo code.

**How do I automate my boring stuff using Python? - Suraj Narwade**

We all complain about doing the repeatative tasks in our day to day lives. We
should definitely try making our lives easier by automating them. In this talk
[Suraj](https://twitter.com/red_suraj) explained how he have automated his task of social media volunteering in
[PyCon India 2016](https://in.pycon.org/2016/), by writing a simple python script to tweet about the talks at
regular intervals of around 2 hours. Here is the [script](https://gist.github.com/surajnarwade/) by
[Suraj](https://twitter.com/red_suraj).

Lot of project ideas came from the attendees itself. Many of them also shared
few of their [automation ideas](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/boring_scripts).

**Writing unit tests for any Python Script - Sudhir Verma**

![Sudhir in unit test talk](/img/julymeet16/sudhir.jpg)

Unit testing is considered an essential part of software development. Through
unit testing, we can evaluate each code component, find out how well it
performs, and determine how well it reacts to valid or invalid input. A
regression suite of unit tests is also an excellent way of detecting unexpected
changes in a code base caused by refactoring or writing new code.

[Sudhir](https://www.facebook.com/sudhirvvermaa) explained how he uses unit
tests for  his projects.

**Static v/s Dynamically typed languages - Ganesh Kadam**

![Me in my lightning talk](/img/julymeet16/ganesh.jpg)

This was just a lightning talk about static v/s dynamically typed language.
[I](https://twitter.com/meganeshkadam) just spoke briefly on this topic, with respect to the blog I have read on
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10402307) that [Chandan](https://twitter.com/ciypro) has asked
us to read. This blog was about the [ASCIINEMA](http://blog.asciinema.org/) application that records the sessions
on your bash shell and uploads it to their [website](https://asciinema.org/), so that it can be used to share.
[ASCIINEMA](http://blog.asciinema.org/) was ported back to Python from Golang. We just discussed how we
should choose the apporpirate programming languages depending on our
requirements. It was a good learning experience.
