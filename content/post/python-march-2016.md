Python Pune Meetup March 2016 was organized at Amazatic Solutions on 26th March 2016. Following was the agenda for this meetup :

-   Workshop : Vim & frameworks by Devchandra L
-   Talk1 : Libvert Programming API by Amol Kahat
-   Talk2 : Fedora Hubs by Dhriti Shikhar

@cyipro started the meetup initially with an introduction to Python and OpenSource. The majority of attendees were students so it was very helpful for them.

Amol Kahat started with the first talk of this meet up on libvirt-api he is a Red Hat intern. libvert is a toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent versions of Linux. It is a free and opensource software available under GPL license. Amol explained about the virtualization technology, hypervisors and how the libvert-api is different from the other available options. To know more information on libvirt-apis, here is the link :

@vega\_yaa is the organizer of Pune Vim Users Group. The main motto of this group is to help people start using vim and to share knowledge about the same. @vega\_yaa started with vim workshop after Amol's talk by explaining a little history of vi and vim, later on also explained few differences in bertween them.It was for all the novices as well as for the people who already use vim for their daily use but are unaware of the vim's power. Starting with very basics, he explained why we should use vim, and its magic once you get used to it. Attendees got a hands-on session on vim, for example starting with how you should open multiple files using vim, how to use alias, Buffermode in vim, various options like split, vsplit, tabnewfile, code folding in vim etc.Though it sounds very simple, knowing essentials of vim will definitely boost the productivity. Here are the slides for this workshop :
