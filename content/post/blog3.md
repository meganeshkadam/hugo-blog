Week \# 9
=========

Finally, few issues in my bash script are resolved. Now I need to test it on the other environments and work further on the validation part, and optimization.The script has helped me a lot in understanding OpenStack-APIs, CURL concepts, and other bash scripting skills. Also, I am attending the weekly \#rdo meetings on IRC giving me a good insight of what all things are coming up in the next release of RDO.

Here are the links I used while writing bash script:

-   [OpenStack netwowking API Reference](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2-ext.html#addRouterInterface)
-   [Neutron API](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/APIv2-specification)
-   [Ask OpenStack](https://ask.openstack.org/)
-   [CURL](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html)
-   [Bash](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)

We were given an opportunity to volunteer the Python Pune meetup. It was a nice experience in February devsprint2016 \#1, and a great Learning.

I also volunteered for the gnuNIFY 2016 last month. Attended few workshops as well. @ramky took an awsome Python workshop, he started with absolute basics, and at the end, he also discussed on Big Data, Machine Learning and few advanced topics.

We have started to prepare for the Red Hat certifications as well.Initially, we have started with RHCSA, then we will focus on RHCE and then on Red Hat OpenStack Certification track.
